# webar-experiments

A bunch of experiments around creating an in-browser augmented reality experience.

Nothing in here is polished or anything!

I wrote about what I did here on my blog: http://jensarps.de/2016/02/22/webar-combining-cardboard-style-vr-and-the-phones-camera/

You can try out these experiments on  GitHub pages, e.g. https://jensarps.github.io/webar-experiments/one/

If you clone this and run at home, keep in mind you need to serve the pages via HTTPS to get access to the camera.
